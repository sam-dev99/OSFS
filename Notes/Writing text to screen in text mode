GOAL OF THIS DRIVER
We have built a piece of code that could write a set of characters to the tele-typewriter(terminal).
TO write a single character, we start writing at address "0xB8000".
every character is written in the following manner: 
 - first byte represents the ascii character to write
 - second byte represents the color formation
 and so on...

    
uint16_t* video_mem = (uint16_t*)(0xB8000);

//first byte is fo ascii character
video_mem[0] = 'A';
//second byte for color
video_mem[1] = 2;

//the above was changing row 0 col 0 of the terminal
video_mem[2] = 'B';
video_mem[3] = 4;
