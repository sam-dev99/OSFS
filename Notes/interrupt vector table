IVT(interrupt vector table):
    - it consists of entries (4 bytes each)
    - each entry is further divided into 2 bytes for offset and another 2 bytes of where    the segment is. the combination of these give us the absolute memory  in RAM.
    - this allows us to create interrupts and call them based on this scheme.
